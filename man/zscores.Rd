\title{Compute z-scores for the top features in each topic within a MuData
 object.}
\usage{
zscores(object, mod = NULL, n_top = 10, thr = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat object containing multimodal single-cell data.}

\item{mod}{Specific modality to compute z-scores for. If NULL, z-scores are
computed for all modalities. Default is NULL.}

\item{n_top}{Number of top features to select for each topic based on their
importance in the topic signature. Default is 10.}

\item{thr}{Threshold to cap the computed z-scores. Z-scores will be limited
to the range [-thr, thr]. Default is 5.}
}
\description{
This function calculates z-scores for the top features
 associated with each topic in the specified modality or across all
 modalities of a Seurat object. Z-scores are computed using normalized and
 log-transformed raw count data, allowing for a standardized comparison of
 feature expression levels relative to their mean and standard deviation
 across all cells. Computed z-scores are capped within a specified threshold
 range to limit extreme values.
}
\note{
Z-scores are computed as (x - mean) / std, where x is the log-
 transformed expression value of a feature, mean is the mean across all
 cells, and std is the standard deviation across all cells.

The top n_top features for each topic are selected based on their
 importance in the topic signatures (highest weights).

Extreme z-scores are capped to the range [-thr, thr] to mitigate the
 impact of outliers.
