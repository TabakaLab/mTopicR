\title{Visualize the significance of topics based on their maximum
 probability across cells.}
\usage{
plot_filter_topics(
  model,
  s = 50,
  figsize = c(8, 6),
  fontsize = 10,
  transparent = FALSE,
  save = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An instance of a MTM or sMTM model containing the topic
distributionss (gamma) to analyze.}

\item{s}{Marker size for the scatter plot. Default is 50.}

\item{figsize}{Vector specifying the size of the figure c(width, height) in
inches. Default is c(8, 6).}

\item{fontsize}{Font size for plot labels and annotations. Default is 10.}

\item{transparent}{Whether to save the figure with a transparent background.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{save}{Path to save the figure. If NULL, the figure is displayed but
not saved. Default is NULL.}
}
\description{
This function generates a scatter plot to show the maximum
 probability of each topic across all cells. Topics with higher
 maximum probabilities represent significant patterns in the dataset, while
 topics with low maximum probabilities might be less informative or represent
 noise. The plot includes a suggested threshold line (default at y = 0.01)
 to help identify insignificant topics for filtering in downstream analysis.
