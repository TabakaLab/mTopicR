\title{Detect and visualize overrepresented features using a knee detection
 algorithm.}
\usage{
plot_filter_var_knee(
  model,
  mod,
  knee_sensitivities = c(1, 2, 5, 10),
  s = 20,
  figsize = c(8, 6),
  fontsize = 10,
  annotate_features = FALSE,
  show_frac = 1,
  log_scale = TRUE,
  transparent = FALSE,
  save = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{An instance of a MTM or sMTM model containing the topic-feature
distributions.}

\item{mod}{The modality to analyze (e.g., ‘rna’, ‘protein’).}

\item{knee_sensitivities}{List of sensitivities for the knee detection
algorithm. Higher sensitivity values detect more subtle changes. Default
is c(1, 2, 5, 10).}

\item{s}{Marker size for the scatter plot. Default is 20.}

\item{figsize}{Tuple specifying the size of the figure (width, height) in
inches. Default is c(8, 6).}

\item{fontsize}{Font size for plot labels, annotations, and ticks. Default
is 10.}

\item{annotate_features}{Whether to annotate feature names on the plot. If
TRUE, feature names will be displayed near their points. Default is FALSE.}

\item{show_frac}{Fraction of the top features to display based on their
cumulative activity. Default is 1 (all features).}

\item{log_scale}{Whether to apply a log scale to the y-axis for feature
activity. Default is TRUE.}

\item{transparent}{If TRUE, saves the figure with a transparent background.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{save}{Path to save the figure. If NULL, the figure is displayed but
not saved. Default is NULL.}
}
\description{
This function identifies and visualizes features (e.g., genes)
 that are overrepresented across all topics in a specified modality of a
 topic model. By plotting the cumulative activity of features across topics,
 it applies a knee detection algorithm to find points of significant
 activity drop, which can be used to filter out less informative features
 in downstream analysis.

 Multiple knee points are calculated using varying sensitivities, providing
 insight into how the detection threshold affects the selection of
 overrepresented features.
}
\note{
This function is an implementation of the scmtm.pl.filter_var_knee
 function from the original scmtm Python package.
