\title{Spatial Multimodal Topic Model (sMTM) for single-cell spatial data
 analysis.}
\usage{
sMTM(
  object,
  n_topics = 20,
  radius = 0.05,
  n_neighbors = NULL,
  cache_similarities = FALSE,
  seed = 2291,
  n_jobs = -1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat object containing multimodal single-cell spatial
data, including spatial coordinates in the obsm attribute.}

\item{n_topics}{Number of topics to infer. Each topic represents a distinct
spatial pattern across features and modalities. Default is 20.}

\item{radius}{Radius for constructing a spatial neighborhood graph. Used if
n_neighbors is None. Default is 0.05.}

\item{n_neighbors}{Number of neighbors to consider when constructing the
spatial neighborhood graph. Overrides radius if set. Default is NULL.}

\item{cache_similarities}{If TRUE, caches spatial similarity information for
each update during Variational Inference. Default is FALSE.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility. Ensures consistent
initialization and results. Default is 2291.}

\item{n_jobs}{Number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing. If set
to -1, uses all available cores. Default is -1.}
}
\value{
A new Seurat object.
}
\description{
This class implements a Spatial Multimodal Topic Model (sMTM)
 designed for analyzing single-cell spatial data across multiple modalities.
 The model captures spatial relationships by constructing a spatial
 neighborhood graph and uses Variational Inference (VI) to identify
 spatially-aware topics. These topics represent patterns across features
 and modalities while incorporating spatial information.
