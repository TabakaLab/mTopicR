\title{Perform Centered Log-Ratio (CLR) normalization on a modality in a
 Seurat object.}
\usage{
clr(object, mod)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Seurat object containing multimodal single-cell data.}

\item{mod}{The modality to which CLR normalization will be applied.}
}
\description{
This function applies CLR normalization to the specified
 modality within a Seurat object. CLR normalization is widely used for
 compositional data, such as single-cell protein counts. It calculates
 the geometric mean of counts for each cell, normalizes each feature by
 dividing its count by the geometric mean, and applies a log transformation.
 This normalization helps mitigate the effects of varying library sizes and
 technical biases.
}
\note{
The CLR normalization follows these steps: 1. Compute the geometric
 mean of counts for each cell (row) across all features (columns). 2. Divide
 each feature count by the geometric mean of its respective cell. 3. Apply a
 log1p transformation (log(x + 1)) to the normalized data.

A small pseudocount (1e-6) is added to the geometric mean to avoid
 division by zero errors.
