\title{Randomly permute the count matrices.}
\usage{
permute(object, subset = NULL, seed = 2291, sparse_mode = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat object containing multiple modalities.}

\item{subset}{The number of cells (observations) to randomly subset
before performing permutation. If NULL, all cells are used. Default is
NULL.}

\item{seed}{Seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility
of the permutation. Default is 2291.}

\item{sparse_mode}{If FALSE, performs permutation on dense matrices (after
converting to dense). Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A new Seurat object with permuted data.
}
\description{
This function randomly permutes the counts within each column
 of the count matrices in each modality. Permutations are performed either
 on dense matrices or sparse matrices based on the sparse_mode parameter.
 Basic filtering is applied to retain only non-empty cells and features.
}
\note{
Filtering is applied using scanpy.pp.filter_cells() and
 scanpy.pp.filter_genes() to remove empty cells and features.

The function uses muon.pp.intersect_obs() to ensure consistency across
 modalities after filtering.
