\usage{
plot_feature_activity(
  object,
  x,
  features = NULL,
  cmap = "gnuplot",
  marker = ".",
  s = 20,
  p_top = 99,
  fontsize = 10,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat object containing multimodal single-cell data,
including spatial coordinates and expression matrices.}

\item{x}{A name of the embedding to use for plotting (e.g., UMAP, PCA).
If equal to ’Spatial’ tries to use spot coordinates.}

\item{features}{A vector of features (e.g., genes or proteins) to visualize.}

\item{cmap}{The colormap to use for visualizing feature activity. Default
is ‘gnuplot’.}

\item{marker}{Marker style for scatter plots. Default is ‘.’.}

\item{s}{Marker size in the scatter plots. Default is 10.}

\item{p_top}{Percentile threshold to highlight top feature activity values.
Points above this percentile are displayed prominently. Default is 99.}

\item{fontsize}{Font size for plot titles and colorbar ticks. Default
is 10.}

\item{figsize}{Vector specifying the figure size (width, height) in inches.
If NULL, size is automatically determined based on the number of features.
Default is NULL.}

\item{transparent}{If True, saves the figure with a transparent background.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{save}{Path to save the figure. If NULL, the figure is displayed but
not saved. Default is None.}
}
\description{
This function plots the spatial or embedding-based distribution
 of specified features (e.g., genes or proteins) across a sample dataset.
 Each feature is visualized individually, highlighting regions with high or
 low activity levels. This allows users to identify spatial patterns or
 clusters of cells associated with specific features.
