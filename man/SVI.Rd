\title{Perform Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) for large-scale data.}
\usage{
SVI(
  model,
  n_batches = 100,
  batch_size = 100,
  tau = 1,
  kappa = 0.75,
  max_iter_d = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A MTM model.}

\item{n_batches}{Number of batches to divide the data into. Default is 100.}

\item{batch_size}{Number of samples per batch. Smaller batch sizes use less
memory but result in noisier updates. Default is 100.}

\item{tau}{Initial learning rate for SVI. Default is 1.0.}

\item{kappa}{Learning rate decay parameter. Typically between 0.5 and 1.0.
Default is 0.75.}

\item{max_iter_d}{Maximum iterations for the E-step in each SVI update.
Default is 100.}
}
\value{
A MTM object.
}
\description{
SVI divides the dataset into batches and uses stochastic
 updates to infer topics. This method is efficient for large datasets
 where processing the entire dataset at once is computationally expensive.
