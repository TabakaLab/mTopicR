\title{Filter overrepresented features from a Seurat object using a knee
 detection algorithm.}
\usage{
filter_var_knee(object, model, knee_sensitivity = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A raw, unfiltered Seurat object to be processed.}

\item{model}{An instance of a topic model containing the topic-feature
distributions (e.g., lambda_ matrix for each modality).}

\item{knee_sensitivity}{Sensitivity for the knee detection algorithm. Higher
values make the algorithm more conservative in identifying overrepresented
features. It can be a single integer (global for all modalities) or a
dictionary specifying sensitivity per modality. Default is 5.}
}
\value{
A Seurat object with overrepresented features removed.
}
\description{
This function identifies and removes overrepresented features
 (e.g., genes, proteins) across all topics in each modality of a Seurat
 object using a knee detection algorithm. Overrepresented features, which
 are beyond a significant drop-off point (knee point) in their cumulative
 activity, are filtered out to improve data quality and downstream analysis.
}
\note{
Feature Identification: Overrepresented features are identified by
 calculating their cumulative activity across all topics in a modality.
 The knee detection algorithm (kneed) detects the knee point, beyond which
 features are considered overrepresented.

Knee Sensitivity: The knee_sensitivity parameter can be set globally
 for all modalities or specified individually for each modality as a
 dictionary. This allows flexibility based on the characteristics of each
 modality.

Applicability: This approach is ideal for filtering features that
 dominate topic distributions, which may obscure meaningful patterns.
