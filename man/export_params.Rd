\title{Export model parameters (gamma and lambda) to a Seurat object and
 filter insignificant topics.}
\usage{
export_params(
  model,
  object,
  filter_topics = TRUE,
  filter_threshold = 0.01,
  normalize = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A MTM model containing the parameters (gamma and lambda) to be
exported}

\item{object}{A Seurat object to which the parameters will be exported.}

\item{filter_topics}{Whether to filter topics based on their maximum
probability across cells. If TRUE, only topics with a maximum
probability above filter_threshold are retained. Default is TRUE.}

\item{filter_threshold}{The threshold for filtering topics when
filter_topics is TRUE. Topics with a maximum probability below this
threshold are removed. Default is 0.01.}

\item{normalize}{Whether to normalize the topic-cell distributions (gamma).
If TRUE, normalizes rows of gamma so that each row sums to 1. Default is
TRUE.}
}
\value{
A Seurat object containing topic proportions for each sample and
 topic-feature distributions for each modality.
}
\description{
This function exports topic-cell distributions (gamma) and
 feature-topic distributions (lambda) from the given model into the 'mTopic'
 reduction and modality meta data. Users can apply optional filtering to
 remove topics with probabilities below a specified threshold, which helps
 focus on meaningful patterns.
}
\note{
Gamma (Topic Proportions) are stored in the reduction named mTopic

Lambda (Topic-Feature Distributions) are stored for each modality in
 object[[modality]]@meta.data
}
