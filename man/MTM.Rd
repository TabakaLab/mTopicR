\title{Multimodal Topic Model (MTM) for single-cell data analysis.}
\usage{
MTM(object, n_topics = 20, seed = 2291, n_jobs = -1)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A Seurat object containing multiple modalities. Each modality
represents a feature space (e.g., RNA, ATAC, protein), which is used for
topic modeling.}

\item{n_topics}{The number of latent topics to infer. Each topic corresponds
to a distinct pattern or feature distribution across modalities. Default
is 20.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility. Ensures consistent
initialization and results. Default is 2291.}

\item{n_jobs}{Number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing. If set
to -1, uses all available cores. Default is -1.}
}
\value{
MTM object.
}
\description{
This class implements a Multimodal Topic Model (MTM) for
 analyzing single-cell data across multiple modalities. It is designed to
 discover latent topics that capture patterns and relationships between
 features across modalities. MTM can be trained using Variational Inference
 (VI) or Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) for efficient learning from
 large datasets.
